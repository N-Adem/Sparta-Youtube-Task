        <p class="text"> Higher education leaders have written to MPs to say it is "no exaggeration" to warn that it would take universities "decades to recover".
                They say it would undermine scientific research and threaten universities' Â£21bn contribution to the UK economy.
                The government has said its immigration plans will keep universities "open to the talent we need from Europe".
                A joint letter sent to all MPs on behalf of the heads of 150 UK universities says: "Vital research links will be compromised, from new cancer treatments to technologies combating climate change. 
                "The valuable exchange of students, staff and knowledge would be seriously damaged," adds the letter from university groups including Universities UK, the Russell Group, Guild HE, Million Plus and University Alliance. </p>

        <p class="text">The CES trade show is powering up again in Vegas. Most of the biggest names in tech and stacks of start-ups you've never heard of will compete for attention over the next week.
           Some products may launch new categories - past events presented a first look at video cassette recorders (VCRs), organic light-emitting diode (OLED) TVs and Android tablets. But many more will flop or never even make it to market. </p>

        <p class="text">AI assistants and smart living
        One of the biggest developments at the last few CES expos has been Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant's rival efforts to extend their reach in the home and beyond.                
        Last year things peaked with an Alexa-activated toilet flush, but over the past 12 months manufacturers have developed voice-controlled "skills" or "actions" for more products, and in some cases embedded one of the virtual assistants outright.</p>
